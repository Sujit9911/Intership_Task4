Project Description

The AI Recommendation System is a Java-based console application developed to demonstrate how basic artificial intelligence concepts can be applied to generate personalized recommendations based on user input.

This project follows a layered MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture, ensuring proper separation of concerns and clean code structure. The system analyzes user preferences and suggests relevant items using simple decision logic, making it beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

The application simulates a recommendation engine similar to those used in e-commerce and content platforms.

Features

User preference–based recommendations

Console-based interactive interface

Menu-driven application flow

Layered MVC architecture

Clean and modular code structure

Proper exception handling

Beginner-friendly AI logic

Project Architecture

The project follows a three-layer architecture:

Controller Layer

Handles user input, menu navigation, and forwards requests to the Service layer.

Service Layer

Contains recommendation logic and acts as an intermediary between Controller and DAO layers.

DAO Layer

Handles data storage, retrieval, and processing required for generating recommendations.

Technologies Used

Java

Java Util Package

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

Basic Artificial Intelligence Logic

MVC Architecture

Working Flow

User launches the application.

User provides preferences or selects options from the menu.

Controller forwards input to the Service layer.

Service layer processes data and applies recommendation logic.

Recommended items are displayed on the console.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates core Java concepts along with basic artificial intelligence principles, recommendation logic, and layered MVC design. It provides a strong foundation for understanding how real-world recommendation systems work at a fundamental level using Java
